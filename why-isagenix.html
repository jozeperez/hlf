                <p>Isagenix is an organic “food system” that takes a balanced lifestyle approach to better supporting the body’s natural cleansing and replenishing needs. It is NOT a “diet” BUT a sustainable “lifestyle”, NOT a “weight-loss program” BUT a “body composition system” that builds muscle while burning fat, and NOT a “fast or detox program” BUT a “nutritional cleanse” that supports the body’s natural cleansing/replenishing processes with whole-food nutrition.</p>
                <p>As the world’s first &amp; ONLY “total body, deep cellular nutritional cleansing and replenishing system” it delivers many unique and diverse benefits for EVERY single cell and organ system from athletes to non-athletes…Being such a comprehensive system, it is adaptable to ALL ages and goals.</p>

                <p>When it comes down to it, it’s quality, purity, potency and providing essential and specific nutrients such as amino acids, essential fats, key botanicals, antioxidants and minerals, trace minerals that the body needs. All of these things work synergistically together, aiding the body’s functions and systems like- detoxification, digestion and absorption, cellular growth and brain health.</p>

                <p>There are things in our products that you cannot get anywhere in the world- one being the 70 plus minerals and trace minerals. These minerals light up the body internally, helping with cellular detoxification and 95% of all bodily functions. Another thing is the undenatured whey protein within our shakes that’s exclusive to Isagenix. This protein comes from organically raised cattle that are milked according to season. You cannot get a better, more absorbable protein on the planet. It has an extensive amino acid profile that assist in all tissue repair and cell development but aids in brain health and happiness!</p>
